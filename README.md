## What
Convert a bunch of MacOS webloc url link files to a single CSV file 

## Why
Despite using bookmarks and raindrop to save links I sometimes also will drag a weblink for something I think it really neat or important to my desktop. 

This ends up meaning I have dozens of them by the end of a month and need to just move them to a CSV and, probably, just import them to Raindrop instead -- my main place to dump links. 

This will help me do this faster, hopefully, and keep the date the link was created.
